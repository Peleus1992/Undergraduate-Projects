Project Name: Research on Time Synchronization Algorithm for WSNs
Date: 11/2013-?
Team Member: Guo Weidong, Liu Jie, Qiu Tie
Objective:
work out the energy efficient and accurate time synchronization algorithm 
Responsibility: 
1. draw up the algorithm proposal after poring over analogous theses and consulting my adviser 
2. simulate the algorithm mentioned above and other algorithms on NS-2 in Ubuntu, and compare their parameters on time accuracy, energy consumption, packet loss probability and delay
3. compile the thesis 

./code
Open source code for both simulation on NS-2 and real environment testing. Simulation includes our approach STETS and two other approach for comparison. Real environment testing is based on STM32.
./paper
The final version of paper composed using Latex.
